### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Faisal Ahmed working as a software engineer since 2017. 
I love to work with backend programming beside PHP and Node JS.
My preferred Database Mongo DB, MySQL. I like to work with ORM (powerful method for designing and querying database models). I always try to make sure the system is ok and never keep loose ends when I work to develop any system. Looking for a better opportunity to learn more and bloom my expertise.
